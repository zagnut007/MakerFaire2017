Badge code and instructions for the 2017 NOLA Mini Maker Faire VIP Badge Kit

You can purchase your VIP tickets for the 2017 New Orleans Mini Maker Faire at: 
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2017-new-orleans-mini-maker-faire-tickets-29504311189

This kit is included with the purchase of the VIP ticket. One kit per VIP ticket.

Be creative! The components chosen for this design were picked with the intention
that you would want to customize your badge to make it your own. Paint it, stain it, 
change the program, add more components, etc. 

If you need help building/customizing your badge, we will have a meetup on April 13th at
the Delgado FabLab at 5pm. 

## Components

The following components are included in the 2017 VIP Badge Kit:

- Arduino Pro Micro with ATmega32U4 5V/16MHz 
- White 128X64 0.96 inch OLED with SPI
- 3 x AAA Battery Pack
- Blue 5mm LED (quantity 3)
- 560 Ohm Resistor, 1/4 W, 5%
- Neck lanyard

## What you'll need

Gather these tools before starting on your build and it will go much smoother!

- Soldering iron and solder
- CA glue (Superglue)
- Hot glue and gun
- 26 gauge hookup wire
- 7/32 drill bit
- Micro USB cable
- Computer with the Arduino IDE loaded

## Building your badge

1. Glue the two chassis layers together
  - Use the CA glue to glue the layers together
  - The bottom-right corner of the top layer should be offet from the edge of the base layer by 3mm from the right and 3mm from the bottom
  - The upper-left corner of the top layer should have a 1mm offset from the left and top of the base layer
  - You can choose which internal/cut pieces to glue on or leave out.

2. Drill out the LED holes
  - If you intend to install the included LEDs, you will want to drill out three holes in the spaces provided just above the "VIP"
  - Be sure to use a backer board when drilling to reduce blowout
  - Use the 7/32 or 5mm drill bit to make the holes

3. Install the LEDs
